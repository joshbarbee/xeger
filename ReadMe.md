Xerger is a tool to reverse-engineer a matching pattern for a PCRE-compliant regular expression. Xerger will return the first match possible.

The grammar for parsing the Regular Expressions comes from [this repo](https://github.com/kean/Regex/blob/main/grammar.ebnf)

Xerger does not support:
- positive / negative lookbehind
- back references
